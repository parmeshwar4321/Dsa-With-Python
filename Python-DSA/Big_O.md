# Big O is compuational complexity of an Alogorithm

## there are 2 types of  computational Complexityy
1. Time Complexity
2. Space COmplexity

---

## Time Complexity-
 amount of time taken by an algo relative to input size

 ## Space Complexity- 
 amount of memory allocated ken by an algo relative to input size


## some examplese of 
```
1. O(n)
2. O(n^2)
3. O(2^n)
    4. O(n.m)
    5. O(logn)
    ```

## when we are talking about complexity, there are only three possible cases
1. Best case scenario
2. Average case scenario
3. Worst case scenario
