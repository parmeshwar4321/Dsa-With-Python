# Data Structures are a way of organizing so that is can be accessed more efficiently depending upon the situation.
#  Data Structures are fundamentals of any programming language around which a program is built. Python helps o learn the fundamental of these data structures in a simpler way as compared to other programming languages.

# Python Data Types
    #Built in Data Types
        #0. Strings- orderd,Immutable,arrays of bytes representing Unicode character
a='String'

        #1. List - ordered,mutable,allow duplicates
a=[1,"apple",2.3]

        #2. Tupple-ordered,immutable,
a=(1,"apple",1.3) or 1,4,5
        #3. Dictionary- ordered,mutable,allow duplicates
a={"key":"value"}
        #4. Set- ordered,mutable,doesn't allow duplicates
a={2,3,4}
        #5. Frozen Set- Immutable
a={3,4,5}
        #6. ByteArray- gives a mutable sequence of integers in the range 0 <= x < 256.
a=(b'\x0c\x03\x19\x02\x1e')


#This are the core  data structure/built in into core python
